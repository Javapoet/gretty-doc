farmStart starts farm web-apps inplace.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle farmStart
----

== Effects
. Each farm web-app gets compiled (if it's not up-to-date).
. If farm configuration link:Gretty-configuration.html#_inplacemode[overrides inplace property] for some web-apps to `false`, then each of these web-apps is assembled into WAR-file (if itâ€™s not up-to-date).
. Embedded servlet-container starts in separate java process against compiled
classes and their dependencies (and, optionally, against WAR-files) and listens for HTTP-requests on
link:Farm-configuration.html#_port[port] (default 8080).
.  Gretty waits for servlet-container process to complete.
.  Gradle script continues normal execution of tasks.

NOTE: by default this task does not depend on any "war" tasks. It's only when you override `inplace` property to `false` are some projects compiled to WAR-files and farmRun depends on respective "war" tasks.

NOTE: this task does not stop Jetty. It is assumed that another gradle process stops it, supposedly +gradle farmStop+.
