Farm configuration defines it's own set of server-specific properties. When you run a farm task, it uses server-specific properties defined in farm configuration and ignores server-specific properties defined in gretty configurations. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
gretty {
  httpPort = 8181
}

farm {
  httpPort = 9191
  webapp project
}
----

* when you invoke `gradle farmRun`, it serves port 9191.
* when you invoke `gradle appRun`, it serves port 8181.

|===
| Property
| Type
| Default
| Purpose

| [[_jvmargs]] jvmArgs
| List<String>
| []
| Additional JVM arguments to servlet-container process.

| [[_servletcontainer]] servletContainer
| String
| 'jetty9'
| Servlet container to be used in farmXXX tasks. Possible values are 'jetty7', 'jetty8', 'jetty9', 'tomcat7', 'tomcat8'.

| [[_managedclassreload]] managedClassReload
| boolean
| false
| When true, Gretty gradle tasks facilitate your web-app with springloaded library, thus allowing to live-reload compiled classes and avoid restarting servlet container. +
See also: link:Hot-deployment.html[Hot deployment].

| [[_host]] host
| String
| "localhost"
| host is passed to servlet-container connectors. If you use HTTPS, host must match CN of the subject DN of the certificate (if you use link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_auto_configuration[HTTP auto-configuration], this is ensured automatically).

| [[_httpenabled]] httpEnabled
| boolean
| true
| When httpEnabled is true, Gretty configures HTTP connector for the designated httpPort. Otherwise HTTP protocol is disabled. Normally either httpEnabled or httpsEnabled should be true.

| [[_httpport]] httpPort
| int
| 8080
| TCP-port used by servlet-container for incoming HTTP-requests.

| [[_port]] port
| int
| 8080
| This property is exactly the same as httpPort

| [[_httpidletimeout]] httpIdleTimeout
| int
| null
| When not null, defines the time, in milliseconds, that the HTTP connection can be idle before it is closed.

| [[_httpsenabled]] httpsEnabled
| boolean
| false
| When httpsEnabled is true, Gretty configures HTTPS connector for the designated httpsPort. Otherwise HTTPS protocol is disabled. Normally either httpEnabled or httpsEnabled should be true. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html[HTTPS support].

| [[_httpsport]] httpsPort
| int
| 8443
| TCP-port used by servlet-container for incoming HTTPS-requests. +
**Attention:** setting httpsPort alone is not enough to enable HTTPS protocol. You must set httpsEnabled=true in order to enable HTTPS.

| [[_sslkeystorepath]] sslKeyStorePath
| String or java.io.File
| null
| Absolute or relative path to the key-store, containing key and certificate for HTTPS connection. If sslKeyStorePath is not specified, all other SSL-related properties are ignored and HTTPS is auto-configured (if it is enabled). +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_manual_configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[_sslkeystorepassword]] sslKeyStorePassword
| String
| null
| Password for the key-store designated by property sslKeyStorePath. +

| sslKeyStorePassword
| Password for the key of this host, stored in key-store designated by property sslKeyStorePath. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_manual_configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[_ssltruststorepath]] sslTrustStorePath
| String or java.io.File
| sslKeyStorePath

| "jetty.xml"
| Name and/or location of "jetty.xml" file. +
