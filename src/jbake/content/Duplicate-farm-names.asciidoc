= Duplicate farm names

If you configure farm with the same name more than once, there's still only one farm with the given name and it's properties are merged:

* each property except web-app list is overridden by later definition
* web-app lists are merged as hashmaps:
** merged web-app list does not contain duplicates
** override properties of web-apps with the same name are also merged as hashmaps

Example:

[source,groovy]
----
farms {
  farm 'A', { 
    httpPort = 8081
    webapp ':ProjectA'
    webapp ':ProjectB', contextPath: '/aaa', inplace: false
  }
  farm 'A', { 
    httpPort = 8082
    webapp ':ProjectB', contextPath: '/bbb'
    webapp ':ProjectC'
  }
}
----

As the result, farm "A" gets `port=8082` and refers three web-apps:

* `webapp ':ProjectA'`
* `webapp ':ProjectB', contextPath: '/bbb', inplace: false`
* `webapp ':ProjectC'`

TIP: Farms are strictly project-specific. If you define farms with the same name in two different projects, they are totally unrelated and are never merged.
