farmRunWar starts farm web-apps as WAR-files, in interactive mode.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle farmRunWar
----

== Effects
. By default each farm web-app is compiled and assembled into WAR-file (if it's not up-to-date).
. If farm configuration link:Gretty-configuration.html#_inplacemode[overrides inplace property] for some web-apps to `true`, then each of these web-apps gets compiled without creating WAR-file (if itâ€™s not up-to-date).
. Embedded servlet-container starts in separate java process against WAR-files (and, optionally, against compiled classes and their dependencies) and listens for HTTP-requests on link:Farm-configuration.html#_port[port] (default 8080).
. Gretty waits for the user keypress.
. When user presses any key (in the same terminal), servlet-container process shuts down.
. Gretty waits for servlet-container process to complete.
. Gradle script continues normal execution of tasks.
